There is an interesting story regarding this game. Once upon a time there was an [Sk Kids Challenge](https://kidschallenge.sk.ru/), where kids up to _17 years old_ compete with each other, which I discovered several weeks before the end of the challenge. I saw it as a tough competition and decided to show my best. The rules stated that you can start making the project any time, so I started brainstorming and making a really playable small game. It turned out to be a little buggy, but rather good.

When the time came, the announcements were made and my game... got to the 10th (last shown) place in the leaderboard. The other projects on the leaderboard were just some tiny one-screened [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) projects; the only reason why my project got to the 10th place is that the administrators probably thought that the game was made by my parents.

I don't take part in stupid children's competitions anymore. I have learned a valuable lesson and only participate in game jams like [GMTK Game Jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Maker%27s_Toolkit) from now on.
